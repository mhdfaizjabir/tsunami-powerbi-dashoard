# Tsunami Forecasting and Analysis Power BI Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project focused on tsunami forecasting and analysis. The project leverages historical tsunami data to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors, aiding in disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

## Repository Contents

- `Tsunami_60104626.pbix`: The Power BI report file containing all the analyses and visualizations.
- `Tsunami_Analysis_Report.pdf`: A PDF export of the Power BI report for quick reference.
- `Tsunami_Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis in CSV format.

## Project Objectives

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze historical tsunami data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use predictive techniques like exponential smoothing and ARIMA models to forecast future tsunami occurrences.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess potential risk factors and provide insights for disaster preparedness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Power BI Desktop]([https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/bc4d3a50-919e-41f6-b75f-8ede11ac4ac2/7cff2f4605f252b0cf89?experience=power-bi)) (for viewing and interacting with the .pbix file)
- A PDF viewer (Open the Tsunami_Analysis_Report.pdf file with any PDF viewer to see a static version of the Power BI report.)
- Tsunami dataset (The dataset used for the analysis is provided in Tsunami_Dataset.csv. This can be used to understand the raw data that was transformed and analyzed in the Power BI report.)

## Analysis Methodology
### Data Cleaning
#### Removed any erroneous data entries.
#### Ensured consistency and accuracy of the dataset.

### Predictive Analysis
#### Exponential Smoothing: Applied to identify trends and seasonality in the historical data.
#### SARIMA Models: Used for advanced forecasting of future tsunami events.

### Visuals Created
#### Time Series Analysis:
#### Visualized historical tsunami data to identify patterns over time.

#### Predictive Modeling:
#### Forecasted future tsunami occurrences using exponential smoothing and ARIMA models.

#### Risk Assessment:
#### Analyzed risk factors and their impact on tsunami occurrences.

### Conclusion
#### This Power BI project provides valuable insights into historical tsunami data and uses predictive models to forecast future events, helping in disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.
